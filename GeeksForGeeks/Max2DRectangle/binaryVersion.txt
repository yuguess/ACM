for binary version
firstly, compress the matrix, for example, by column major  
0 0 1 1 
1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1

can be compressed into

0 0 4 2
3 0 3 1
2 2 2 0
1 1 1 1

then the problem can be solved by using a monotonous queue
right scan and left scan to find right, left limit for each number 
refer to POJ 2559 for detail solution
